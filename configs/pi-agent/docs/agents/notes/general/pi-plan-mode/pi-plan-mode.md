# Pi Discuss, Plan, and Quick modes

## Scope

`configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-plan/` implements four mutually exclusive main-agent states:

1. **Off** — normal Pi behavior with the pre-mode active tool set; only pi-plan restrictions are inactive.
2. **Discuss** — normal response length with trusted read-only lookup plus `ask_user` and `show_files`.
3. **Plan** — project research, optional read-only delegated research, and authorized Markdown plan saving.
4. **Quick** — quick chat, normally 1–4 short sentences, with trusted built-in read-only lookup tools.

`/discuss`, `/plan`, and `/quick` toggle their mode or enable it and submit a task. `Shift+Tab` cycles `Off → Discuss → Plan → Quick → Off`. Mode changes are accepted at any time. Selecting a different mode during a run aborts that run, preserving its latched prompt and tool policy only until settlement. Ordinary interactive input and RPC `prompt` requests arriving during the transition are held until `agent_settled` and then started as fresh top-level turns; multiple held messages start on successive settled turns and remain queued until their replacement run reaches `agent_start`. Busy task forms follow the same boundary, and a newer mode request cancels an older waiting command task. Explicit RPC `steer` and `follow_up` keep their native in-run behavior. Routine transitions do not emit notifications because the footer already shows the selected next-turn mode; errors, deferred-input notices, queued-task cancellation notices, fallback warnings, and explicit status responses remain visible.

## State and lifecycle

The extension persists one `plan-mode.state` custom entry containing the selected mode, Plan template override, authorized plan root/path, and addresses of read-only subagents created in Plan mode. The active-run mode is an ephemeral snapshot latched by `before_agent_start` and cleared by `agent_settled`; tool guards, `save_plan`, and Plan subagent bookkeeping use that snapshot so a pending transition cannot relax or rewrite the current run. State follows the active branch across reload, resume, fork, and `/tree`. The parser accepts the former `{ enabled: boolean }` shape and migrates it to `plan` or `off`.

Entering the first effective restricted mode snapshots the current active tools. Transitions among Discuss, Plan, and Quick filter from the same snapshot after the current run settles. Returning Off restores the snapshot. `session_shutdown` restores it before runtime replacement so the next extension instance does not accidentally snapshot an already-filtered set.

The `plan-mode` status producer uses `󰍩 discuss mode`, ` plan mode`, and `󱐋 quick mode`. `pi-status-line` renders them yellow, green, and blue respectively; the Material Design forum glyph avoids the Font Awesome comments glyph's visual overlap in the configured terminal font.

## Prompt behavior

`before_agent_start` appends a host-controlled block for every active mode:

- Off marks pi-plan restrictions as inactive for the current run and supersedes historical mode claims without weakening unrelated instructions, safety policies, or active-tool restrictions.
- Discuss permits normal response length and organization but forbids implementation and delegation.
- Plan loads the Pi-specific `skills/pi-plan-mode/` boundaries and at most one supplemental tagged planning template.
- Quick requires a direct 1–4 sentence response with no padding or extra sections.

Quick brevity is a prompt-level rule because the extension API does not expose a per-mode provider output-token setting. Tool restrictions are independently enforced by the host.

## Template routing

The base `skills/pi-plan-mode/` skill defines Plan's planning, delegation, and save boundaries. Supplemental loaded skills become candidates only when their top-level frontmatter contains `plan-template: true`. Automatic mode excludes `disable-model-invocation` skills, caps the catalog at 20 entries and descriptions at 1024 characters, and lets the model read exactly one matching `SKILL.md` through Pi's bounded progressive-disclosure flow.

`/plan --skill <name> <task>` is explicit user invocation: it may select a disabled template, validates the tag/readability, and caps direct injection at 50 KiB. If a forced template disappears, persisted selection is cleared before automatic fallback. A selected template's required output layout overrides the base default layout.

Pi discovers root `skills/` as its normal global skill library. Plan mode consumes the already-loaded skill descriptors without a package-relative path or `resources_discover` duplication; the currently tagged templates are `general-planning` and `software-implementation-planning`.

## Main-agent enforcement

Every restricted-mode tool must match exact expected built-in or local-package provenance. Active-tool filtering reduces the model-visible surface; a default-deny `tool_call` guard blocks disallowed or colliding tools even when another extension activates them later.

| Mode | Allowed tool classes |
|---|---|
| Discuss | Quick tools plus trusted local `ask_user`, `show_files` |
| Plan | read tools, previously active `ask_user`/`show_files`/`todo_write`, `save_plan`, trusted local `subagent_*` tools |
| Quick | trusted built-in `read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` |

Bash, general file mutation, team tools, procedure tools, and unknown custom tools are unavailable in all restricted modes.

## Plan subagent enforcement

Plan may delegate only through the trusted local `pi-subagents` package. The guard applies a second policy to those calls:

- typed agents are rejected;
- ids and persistent lifetime are rejected;
- accepted spawns are normalized in-place to fresh ad-hoc one-shot workers with coding tools exactly `read`, `grep`, `find`, and `ls`;
- a worker address becomes Plan-authorized only after a successful spawn result reports `created: true` and an `adhoc/<id>` address;
- authorized addresses persist branch-locally;
- send, steer, cancel, retire, detailed status, and explicit await targets may reference only authorized addresses;
- await-all is rejected because it could consume unrelated subagent work;
- successful retire removes the address from the authorized set.

Fresh one-shot addresses prevent a Plan spawn from waking a pre-existing persistent ad-hoc worker whose definition might contain mutation tools. The subagent runtime itself provides only `report` beyond the forced coding tools, so Plan workers cannot nest or peer-message.

## Plan save exception

The model derives a project-relative Markdown path from loaded project instructions. `save_plan` asks the user to authorize the first exact canonical-project-root/path pair on a session branch and asks again when the project or path changes. Revisions to the authorized path replace the whole document atomically.

Path handling rejects absolute paths, traversal, control characters, non-Markdown targets, symlink components, and non-regular existing targets. Writes are bounded and queued through Pi's shared file-mutation queue. Existing plans preserve permission bits and use an fsynced same-directory temporary file followed by rename; new targets use a create-only hard link so a file that appears after authorization is not overwritten. Confirmation fails closed without UI and times out after two minutes over RPC.

## Boundary

These controls constrain model-visible Pi tools, not the operating system. They do not stop user-entered shell commands, manually invoked slash commands, subagents already running before a mode transition, other extension background work, or external processes. Use an OS-level read-only mount/container when those actors are in scope.

## Verification

Automated policy, save, and template tests:

```bash
node --test \
  configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-plan/extensions/plan/mode-lifecycle.test.ts \
  configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-plan/extensions/plan/policy.test.ts \
  configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-plan/extensions/plan/save.test.ts \
  configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-plan/extensions/plan/templates.test.ts
```

Offline RPC smoke coverage should verify:

1. `get_commands` includes `discuss`, `plan`, `quick`, and `skill:pi-plan-mode` with no `extension_error`.
2. `/discuss on`, `/plan on`, `/quick on`, and `/quick off` publish the expected status sequence without routine notifications.
3. `get_entries` contains branch-local mode states in that same sequence.
