# pi-todo

Claude Code-style todo list for Pi (ref IMG_5781).

The agent plans and tracks only genuinely complex work that naturally has at least
three substantive steps by calling the `todo_write` tool with the **complete** list each
time. Normal updates retain every existing item, including completed history, so a
task cannot disappear instead of visibly becoming complete. One- and two-step tasks,
quick fixes, simple lookups, and a single change plus verification are handled directly
without a todo list. The live checklist renders in an `aboveEditor` widget with a
simple, static title line, the tree hanging off it via a `└` connector, and a blank
padding line below the block:

```
󰝖 Todos · 1/3
└ ✓ Fix store layer          <- completed: green check, dim strikethrough
  □ Fix sandbox/typedefs     <- in progress: accent, bold (shows activeForm)
  □ Fix mail                 <- pending: dim box

```

The title is a **list header, not a working indicator**: no spinner, no elapsed time,
no token count, no dynamic label — Void Agent's loader row owns all of that. It is a
muted `󰝖 Todos` plus a dim progress count, and it renders whenever the list is
non-empty, **working or idle**, so the checklist always reads as what it is.

The widget is a live factory component (not a string-array widget): pi wraps
string-array lines in pi-tui `Text`, which drops blank lines, so the padding row —
and full control over truncation — require a component. Every rendered line is
ANSI-aware truncated to the component width so long items cannot overflow narrow
terminals, and the inserted `...` matches the truncated todo's state color (dim
completed, accent in-progress, normal text pending).

## Surfaces

- **`todo_write` tool** — LLM-callable, and the ONLY way to change the list. Items are
  `{ content, status, activeForm? }` with statuses `pending | in_progress | completed`;
  at most one is `in_progress`, and normalized `content` is a unique stable identity.
  Calls also accept `operation?: update | replace | clear` and `reason?`:
  - `update` (default) is non-destructive: it must retain every existing item while
    statuses, ordering, `activeForm`, and newly discovered work may change. Finished
    tasks are marked `completed` and stay visible; direct omission is rejected.
  - `replace` requires a non-empty list and reason, and is reserved for a direct
    user-requested replan rather than normal progress.
  - `clear` requires an empty list. It is safe after every item is completed; clearing
    unfinished work requires a reason and is reserved for a direct user request or
    abandoned checklist.

  System-prompt guidance also keeps the completed final list visible with the final
  report instead of immediately clearing it.

  The widget is the only surface that draws the list. An accepted call renders no
  result body under the tool row — the call line already carries the done-count and
  the active item — so the checklist is never on screen twice and scrollback does
  not fill with stale copies. Rejected calls still render their message.
- **Finished checklists** — when every item is completed the list is no longer
  tracking anything. It stays visible with the final report, then the runtime
  drops it at `agent_start`, which fires once per user submission (`turn_start`
  fires per model round-trip and would cut a list off mid-task). This is the one
  deterministic removal: nothing is lost, because nothing was outstanding. Lists
  with unfinished work never go this way — telling a follow-up from a pivot needs
  the model, and that stays the semantic decision below.
- **Task/topic pivots** — before each model call, an ephemeral lower-trust context
  message exposes every current checklist identity so the model can distinguish a
  continuation from a clear move to different work, including after compaction. The
  snapshot is refreshed after tool results and disappears immediately after a clear.
  A continuation preserves the list. A new complex task replaces it with a reason;
  simpler new work clears it, with a reason when unfinished. Cleanup is explicitly
  allowed even when the new request is too small to deserve its own checklist. This
  remains a semantic model decision rather than clearing deterministically on every
  prompt, which would incorrectly erase lists during follow-ups.
- **`alt+o`** — the only user control: cycles expanded → collapsed → hidden
  (Claude Code uses `ctrl+t`, but pi core owns that for thinking blocks). There is
  deliberately no slash command. Collapsed keeps the title plus a one-line summary
  with the expand hint:

  ```
  󰝖 Todos · 1/3
  └ □ Fixing sandbox/typedefs · 1/3 done · alt+o expand
  ```

  Long lists never hit pi core's generic 10-line widget cut: past 8 items the
  expanded view windows around the active item with dim `… +n earlier` /
  `… +n more · alt+o` marker rows.
- **Resume and branches** — on `session_start` and `session_tree`, the list is rebuilt
  from the most recent successful `todo_write` result on the active branch. Rejected
  calls and abandoned branches cannot become live state, while `/reload`, resume,
  fork/clone, and tree navigation retain the correct snapshot without extra files.

## Layout

- `extensions/todo/index.ts` — tool, transition enforcement, widget, shortcut, restore.
- `extensions/todo/render.ts` — pure rendering, transition validation, branch extraction.
- `extensions/todo/render.test.ts` — pure unit tests.
- `extensions/todo/extension.test.mjs` — loaded-extension lifecycle tests.

```
node --test \
  configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-todo/extensions/todo/render.test.ts \
  configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-todo/extensions/todo/extension.test.mjs
```

The lifecycle tests use Pi's importable Node distribution when available (set
`PI_SDK_DIR` when it is installed in a nonstandard location). Binary-only Pi
installations still run a black-box RPC load test and skip only the loader-level
lifecycle cases instead of failing the suite.

This repository enables the package through
`"./configs/pi-agent/packages/pi-todo"` in root `settings.json`. Run `/reload`
after changing package activation.
